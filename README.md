# PR Checker Github Actions

## Description

This action will verify the following rules:

- The PR includes at least one of the labels specified in the action configuration.
- The PR should include the following patter on the title `[NOJIRA] foo` or `[FG-123] foo`.

You will not be able to merge the Pull Request if the action is not passing both checks.

## Inputs

- `required_labels` **required** The labels that are required to be present on the Pull Request.
- `title_regex` **required** The regex that the title should match.
